DuelDex
Description: A Yu-Gi-Oh! deck companion that connects physical collecting to a digital experience. Users can view every card via API, but cards appear grayed out until they are scanned with the phone camera to mark them as “scanned/unlocked.” Includes Deck Scanner Reminders and a Shops (Map) tab showing nearby card stores and directions.
Category: Gaming / Companion Tool
Mobile: Camera image-to-text/recognition for scanning; push notifications for reminders; GPS + embedded map for local shops; local storage for offline progress.
Story: Bridges the nostalgia of real card collecting with an organized, digital “dex.” Players grow their verified collection by scanning the cards they actually own and discover nearby places to buy or trade.
Market: Yu-Gi-Oh! players (casual to competitive), collectors, and local card shops.
Habit: Used after pack openings to scan new cards, before meets/tournaments to review decks, and periodically via reminders to keep collections current.
Scope: V1—API browsing, scan-to-unlock, reminders; V2—deck building & favorites; V3—scan history, offline mode; V4—price tracking, account sync.
